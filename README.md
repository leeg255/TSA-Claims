# TSA Claims

## Data Content
This dataset is internal and has been compiled onto Kaggle. The original source is government data provided by the TSA
that is available for anyone to access, so it can be trusted.

The data contains information on claims filed against the TSA for incidents such as personal injuries, lost
property, damaged property, and so on. For example, it includes details on where and when the incident happened, what
was claimed, how much the claim amount is, and more.

## Overview
With the summer season arriving in the northern hemisphere, I felt it could be a timely fit as many people are looking
to fly to their vacation destinations, and may like to know if there are any patterns as to lost/damaged property or
other claims. For example, is there an airline that is known to lose peopleâ€™s luggage?

- The data from Kaggle is too large to upload to Github, so only my cleaned version is available here.
- The Tableau dashboard does not contain all the steps taken during the analysis.
